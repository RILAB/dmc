\arguments{
\item{neutral_freqs}{Matrix of allele frequencies at putatively neutral sites with dimensions,  number of populations x number of sites.}

\item{selected_freqs}{Matrix of allele frequencies at putatively selected sites with dimensions, number of populations x number of sites.}

\item{selected_pops}{Vector of indices for populations that experienced selection.}

\item{positions}{Vector of genomic positions for the selected region.}

\item{n_sites}{Integer for the number of sites to propose as the selected site. Must be less than or equal to length(positions).}

\item{sample_sizes}{Vector of sample sizes of length number of populations. (i.e. twice the number of diploid individuals sampled in each population).}

\item{num_bins}{The number of bins in which to bin alleles a given distance from the proposed selected sites.}

\item{sets}{A list of population indices, where each element in the list contains a vector of populations with a given mode of convergence. For example, if populations 2 and 6 share a mode and population 3 has another, sets = list(c(2,6), 3). Required for modeling multiple modes. Only required for fitting models with mixed modes. Must be used in conjunction with the "modes".}

\item{modes}{Character vector of length sets defining mode for each set of selected populations ("ind", "sv", and/or "mig"). Only required for fitting models with mixed modes.}

\item{sels}{Vector of proposed selection coefficients.}

\item{migs}{Vector of proposed migration rates (proportion of individuals of migrat origin each generation). Cannot be 0.}

\item{times}{Vector of proposed times in generations the variant is standing in populations before selection occurs and prior to migration from source population.}

\item{gs}{Vector of proposed frequencies of the standing variant.}

\item{sources}{Vector of population indices to propose as the source population of the beneficial allele. Used for both the migration and standing variant with source models. Note: the source must be one of the populations contained in selPops.}

\item{Ne}{Effective population size (assumed equal for all populations).}

\item{rec}{Per base recombination rate for the putatively selected region.}

\item{locus_name}{String to name the locus. Helpful if multiple loci will be combined in subsequent analyses. Defaults to "locus".}

\item{cholesky}{Logical to use cholesky factorization of covariance matrix. Faster, but not guaranteed to work for all data sets. TRUE by default. if FALSE, ginv() from MASS is used.}
