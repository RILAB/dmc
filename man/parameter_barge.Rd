\arguments{
\item{allFreqs}{Matrix of allele frequencies at putatively neutral sites with dimension numberOfPopulations x numberOfSites}

\item{selPops}{Vector of indices for populations that were hypothesized to have experienced selection.}

\item{positions}{Vector of genomic positions for putatively selected region.}

\item{n_sites}{Integer for the number of sites to propose as the selected site. Must be less than length(positions).}

\item{sampleSizes}{Vector of sample sizes of length numberOfPopulations. (i.e. twice the number of diploid individuals sampled in each population)}

\item{numPops}{Number of populations sampled (both selected and non-selected)}

\item{sets}{List of length number of different modes of convergence to be specified vector "modes" where each element in list contains vector of populations with a given single mode of convergence i.e. if populations 2 and 6 share a mode and populations 3 has another, sets = list(c(2,6), 3). Required for modeling multiple modes.}

\item{modes}{Character vector of length sets defining mode for each set of selected populations ("ind", "sv", and/or "mig")}

\item{sels}{Vector of proposed selection coefficients.}

\item{migs}{Vector of proposed migration rates (proportion of individuals from source each generation)}

\item{times}{Vector of proposed time in generations the variant is standing in populations before selection occurs and prior to migration from source population}

\item{gs}{Vector of proposed frequencies of the standing variant migs: migration rate (proportion of individuals from source each generation). Note: cannot be 0}

\item{sources}{Vector of proposed source population of the beneficial allele for both migration and standing variant with source models. Note: the source must be a selected population in selPops}

\item{Ne}{Effective population size (Assumed equal across all populations ??)}

\item{rec}{Per base recombination rate for putatively selected region.}

\item{locus_name}{String to name the locus. Helpful if multiple loci will be combined in subsequent analyses. Defaults to "locus"}

\item{freqs_notRand}{Matrix of allele frequencies at putatively selected sites with dimension numberOfPopulations x numberOfSites}

\item{numBins:}{the number of bins in which to bin alleles a given distance from the proposed selected sites}
